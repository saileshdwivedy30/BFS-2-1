# Time Complexity : O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid
# Space Complexity : O(m * n), for the queue used in BFS
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach

# I used BFS to simulate the rotting process level by level (minute by minute)
